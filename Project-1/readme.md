 ---
 ***Catherine Orfanos*** 

 This is my first readme and my encounter with all this new technology, I am definetly **overwhlemed!**


 I am excited to learn how this all works, I am just a bit stressed out at the moment!

 I am most excited about:
 1. learning code!
 2. learning about the internet!
 3. being more experience with this new technology!

 I really have enjoyed the content we have covered so far:
 <li> The videos on the internet</li>
 <li> The 12 chapter on webdevelopment</li>

 <main>
 This is my first time on [GitHub](https://github.com) so I am learning alot as I go.


 I do think I am a well organized person so I feel good in the fact that I can keep all my projects in order. My files are arraged well, ![Screenshot Of my Directory](./images/screenshot-1.png)
 *I am excited to get started with more projects!*

 || Can't wait to see what the rest of the semester holds! ||
