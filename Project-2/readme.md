### **HW-01**
I am going to be making my porject about "How to make the best brownies!"
First I need to do some research on my topic and start with the basic first few lines of my index.html. The doctype and my title. I am getting slightly confused with the head and body lables.... and Im not sure if I am doing them **correctly!**
-I am having a fun tiume creating my website and using sematic markup to make my words pop!
- I also am struggleing to figure out how to link website again! ugh!!!
- Ok, well now I have fugured out the link, I was accedently typing in the wrong link basically and didn't realized that CAPS mattered!
- But now I went back in to update some of my work, and the link isn't updating, so I'm not sure if it just takes a second to do? or if I did domthing wrong!
- It ended up updating and ive gone back and made a few changes with my content

#### Overall I thought this assignment went pretty smooth for me. I had a few bumps but was able to probelm solve on my own. I am excited to get into more code to make our websites even cooler looking!

### **HW-02**

- This week went by really fast for me. I was very nervous to add new pages and all the new requirments for this weeks HW.
- I Started fast and didn't have any problem adding the new pages which was nice
- It was fun to add more to my site and use the new tools we learned, I specifically like the table feature and a few of the form founctions.
- I was overwhelmed with all the new information we had to learn, and I'm hoping what I've submitted today all looks good, because I spent alot of time on my site!
- This week I used the Textbook alot more for help
- I definetly still need to go back and make sure I really know a few of these new elements, especailly surronding the forms because I kinda just winged that and had to go back alot to fix my work!
- I did come across one problem that I didn't have time to look into, for some reason my Form page keeps opening in the middle of tha page and not the top..... so im not sure what I did there (Nevermind! I was able to later figure this out!)
- Overall I had fun making my website more complex this week and learning about images, tables and forms!
