>First I need to do some research on my topic and start with the basic first few lines of my index.html. The doctype, my title. I am getting slightly confused with the head and body lables.... and im not sure if I am doing them **correctly!**
- I also am struggleing to figure out how to link website again! ugh!!!
- Ok, well now I have fugured out the link, I was accedently typing in the wrong link basically and didn't realized that CAPS mattered!
  - But now I went back in to update some of my work, and the link isn't updating, so I'm not sure if it just takes a second to do? or if I did domthing wrong!
