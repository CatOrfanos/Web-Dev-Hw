                WHAT IS RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN?
            </h2>

            <p>
              Responsive web design is a relatively new approach to website design that ensures users have a good viewing experience no matter what type of device they’re using. It’s become increasingly important over the last few years as mobile device ownership has exploded and traditional PC sales have slowed. And now that Google is prioritizing mobile-friendly sites in its search results algorithm, it’s essential to make sure your site is optimized for mobile by using responsive design.

              <strong>Wireframes</strong> are your basic storyboarding sketches to showcase examples of what the site is going to look like on different screens and how the content will be represented.
                <br><br>
              <strong>Flexboxes</strong> are a way to implement scalability with CSS. This tool gives you control of how your content will look on different sizes with ease.
                <br><br>
              <strong>Breakpoints</strong> are specified widths, where your sites layout will adapt and reflow to fit appropriately to the new device width.
