There are many <strong> many </strong> ways of developing a responsive site.
<br><br>
RWD encompasses a few critical ideas;

  A web page should look good, and be easy to use, regardless of the device!
  It is a design strategy that emphasizes “mobile first, with unobtrusive javascript, and progressive enhancement”. Especially as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic.

              <strong>Wireframes</strong> are your basic storyboarding sketches to showcase examples of what the site is going to look like on different screens and how the content will be represented.
                <br><br>
              <strong>Flexboxes</strong> are a way to implement scalability with CSS. This tool gives you control of how your content will look on different sizes with ease.
                <br><br>
              <strong>Breakpoints</strong> are specified widths, where your sites layout will adapt and reflow to fit appropriately to the new device width.
