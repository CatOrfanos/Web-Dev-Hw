                Here are two examples of tools that are used to aid in responsiveness:
                <br> <br>
                <strong>Wireframes</strong> are your basic storyboarding sketches to showcase examples of what the site is going to look like on different screens and how the content will be represented.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Flexboxes</strong> are a way to implement scalability with CSS. This tool gives you control of how your content will look on different sizes with ease.

              <strong>Breakpoints</strong> are specified widths, where your sites layout will adapt and reflow to fit appropriately to the new device width.
