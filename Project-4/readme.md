### Last Week being a Web Dev:
"This last "project" is really just an exercise, where you'll use newly-learned techniques to create a single responsive webpage, along with a very important component of web design - wireframes."

I can't believe its already our last project! This week I learned about new web design techniques, emphasizing **WIREFRAMES**
This week I also learned about;
- media queries
- mobile first development
- responsive web design
- flex boxes


### Site layout:

### My Site will be on: **What is Responsive Web Design?**
MY MAIN CONTENT: "Responsive web design is a fairly new approach to website design. It allows for website users have a good viewing experience no matter what type of device they’re using and with the increase of different sized mobile devices in recent years, it has become increasingly important for website designers to utilize RWD. In todays world it is essential to make sure your site is optimized for mobile by using responsive design."

MORE INFO: "There are many MANY ways of developing a responsive site."

"RWD encompasses a few critical ideas; A web page should look good, and be easy to use, regardless of the device! It is a design strategy that emphasizes “mobile first, with unobtrusive javascript, and progressive enhancement”. Especially as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic."

SPECIAL ELEMENTS: "WIREFRAMES are your basic storyboarding sketches to showcase examples of what the site is going to look like on different screens and how the content will be represented."

"FLEXBOXES are a way to implement scalability with CSS. This tool gives you control of how your content will look on different sizes with ease."

"BREAKPOINTS are specified widths, where your sites layout will adapt and reflow to fit appropriately to the new device width."

Media Items I will include:

Fonts I am going to Use:
- Barlow
- Open+Sans+Condensed

Colors:
- #8dc5d1
- #f7ee42
- #e6922f
- #b8436b

**SITE INFO:**

**1. What is the information this page aims to deliver?** On this page I will define responsive webdesign and provide eamples with pictures.

**2. What is the first information on the page that should draw the eye?** Since this project is on Resonsive Web Design, I want the first thing views to notice is the organization and layout of the page. Information wise, the first peice of content I want the view to be drwn to is the title and simple and easy definition on RWD.

**3. What is the primary content of this page?** The primary content of this page will include a descripion and examples (Text and media) of RWD.

**4. What is the secondary content?**

### Creating the Site:
1. Sketch and Wireframe
2. Identify Possible Structure
3. Start to Build the Site with HTML and CSS
4. Test my Site on differnet interfaces

Update 1: So far so good with my first attempt at creating this page! Changes I need to make before in my next steps, include making the picture size smaller, adding a navigation bar and deveopling my text content more! Also my first test on my phone screen works pretty good! almost better than my desktop version.

Update 2: All finished I think this was a great assignment, and I am happy we learned about responsive web design because it makes the site look so much better.
