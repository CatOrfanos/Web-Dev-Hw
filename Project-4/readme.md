**2. What is the first information on the page that should draw the eye?** Since this project is on Resonsive Web Design, I want the first thing views to notice is the organization and layout of the page. Information wise, the first peice of content I want the view to be drwn to is the title and simple and easy definition on RWD.

### Creating the Site:

2. Identify Possible Structure
3. Start to Build the Site with HTML and CSS
4. Test my Site on differnet interfaces

Update 1: So far so good with my first attempt at creating this page! Changes I need to make before in my next steps, include making the picture size smaller, adding a navigation bar and deveopling my text content more! Also my first test on my phone screen works pretty good! almost better than my desktop version
