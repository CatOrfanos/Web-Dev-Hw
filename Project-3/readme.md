***Disclaimer:*** my site may look very different on your screen! I noticed after I had finsihed that when I make my sreen smaller my pitcures hide behind my text!!!! :( I am still working on fixing that bug! If anyone also encountered this problem and was about to find a work around please let me know! Thanks and enjoy!

This site (https://codepen.io/CrocoDillon/pen/kmGCw) almsot helped me fix it, but I was unable to make it work for my content. 

### **Week 1:** This week we started to learn more about CSS

This project I will create a literature showcase site, either being:
- A Blog
- An Article
- **Book**, Essay or Poem

My Outcomes:
- 3 Page Site
- Emphasis on Styling
- Clean, graphic display, highlighting written content
- Use of IDs, classes, and pseudo-classes.

This week I learned about:
- Select and declare
- Property and Value
- Style Guide
- Commenting in CSS
- Selectors and changing Selectors
- Text Color and Background Color

Laying out my ideas:
1. What type of writer’s site do you think you’ll make? **Book showcase on my faveorite book from when I was a kid!**
2. Where will you get your material? **from this [site](http://www.umich.edu/~childlit/Weslandia/WESTframeset1.htm)**
3. What will you say about the author, even if it’s yourself? **I will talk about how creative the author/illustrator is and also the fun story line in the book**
4. Include an image of your color palette. You should have 2-6 colors max! #006598 #82b440 #95212c #fbcf61 and #FFFFE0

### **Week 2**
This week I started the creation of my new repo!I got VERY behind in my creation of this project because of a concussion, so I am trying my best to get this all done. This week has been crazy, because Im trying to do it all on my own without throughly reading everything because I have limited time to catch up:/

### **Week 3**
Well I got through last week and I've made some great progress with my Weslandia Site!! Overall my process with this project went fairly smooth!

What I Struggled with during the week:
- I couldn't get my < aside > to work properly! I had my main content and wanted pictures on the side, but inline-block was not working for me. I ended up having to make the position of my content absolute and float my aside.
- I have not been able to figure out why my pictures move being my content whent the screen size gets smaller!!
- I almsot feel like I was getting lucky on a few things so I still don't feel 100% confident in CSS styling, so I definetly need to reread some of the website material because I had to read through it so fast the first time!


What I'm happy about with my fianl Project:
- I am happy with the over all look of my site, I think I sucsessfuly executed my objectives!
  - Emphasis on Styling
  - Clean, graphic display, highlighting written content
  - Use of IDs, classes, and pseudo-classes.
