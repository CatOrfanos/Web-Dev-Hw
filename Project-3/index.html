             <p>I am very excited to be sharing one of my faveorite chilhood books. I first read this book when I was a child and I thought it was a great story line and made me think that  <em id="strong-color"> anything </em> was possible. The pictures in the book are also very pretty to look and and really makes the book come to <strong> life </strong>. </p>

             <p><span class="review1"><q cite="PUBLISHERS WEEKLY">This fantastical picture book, like its hero, is bursting at the seams with creativity. . . . a vigorous shot in the arm to nonconformists everywhere</q> PUBLISHERS WEEKLY </span></p>
             <p><span class="review2"><q cite="Goofygirl13, Customer Review">This was one of my FAVORITE picture books in elementary school (about 12 years ago). It obviously left an impression because I still remember it all these years later, and I just bought it for a child I know. Weslandia is far more creative than many picture books, and it is also educational. Kids will learn a lot about aspects of civilizations and how they develop. I hope this book stays in print for many years to come so that I can read it to my children. This book may be challenging for younger readers. I would recommend it for 8 year-olds and up.</q>
